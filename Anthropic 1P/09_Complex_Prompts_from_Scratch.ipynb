In 1994, Barclay Slocum obtained patents for the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy procedure, which is used in the treatment of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and for the devices used in the procedure. During 2006, Slocum Enterprises filed a patent infringement suit against New Generation Devices, arguing that the Unity Cruciate Plate manufactured by New Generation infringed on the patent for the Slocum TPLO plate. However, the court never reached a decision on the issue of patent infringement, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the small number of plates sold in the state in which the case was filed and the information provided on a Web site maintained by Slocum Enterprises. Other patent battles waged during 2006 concerned the use of laser technology for onychectomy in cats, pet identification chips, pig vaccines, and pet “deshedding” tools.\n",

The court held that the intention of the legislature in passing the Veterinary Profession Act was the protection of the public and animals and further held that monopolistic statutes serve the purpose of protecting the public. In addition, the court concluded that dentistry, at its core, relates to the health of the teeth and gums; is distinct from cosmetic and other types of care of animals; and, therefore, falls under the definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. The nonveterinarian was enjoined from providing services without a veterinarian supervising the procedures.\n",

In addition, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act during 2006, which requires state and local emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans information on how they will accommodate household pets and service animals in case of a disaster. California passed a law that will require its Office of Emergency Services, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies involved with disaster response preparation to develop a plan for the needs of service animals, livestock, equids, and household pets in the event of a disaster or major emergency.\n",

    "The animal health industry became caught up in a number of patent and trademark lawsuits during the past year. In 1994, Barclay Slocum obtained patents for the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy procedure, which is used in the treatment of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and for the devices used in the procedure. During 2006, Slocum Enterprises filed a patent infringement suit against New Generation Devices, arguing that the Unity Cruciate Plate manufactured by New Generation infringed on the patent for the Slocum TPLO plate. However, the court never reached a decision on the issue of patent infringement, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the small number of plates sold in the state in which the case was filed and the information provided on a Web site maintained by Slocum Enterprises. Other patent battles waged during 2006 concerned the use of laser technology for onychectomy in cats, pet identification chips, pig vaccines, and pet “deshedding” tools.\n",

    "In Canada, the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association brought suit against a nonveterinarian, claiming that he engaged in cutting or otherwise removing hooks from horses' teeth and floating horses' teeth with power and manual tools, provided advice and diagnoses in return for a fee, and held himself out as being qualified and willing to provide treatment with respect to these activities. The court held that the intention of the legislature in passing the Veterinary Profession Act was the protection of the public and animals and further held that monopolistic statutes serve the purpose of protecting the public. In addition, the court concluded that dentistry, at its core, relates to the health of the teeth and gums; is distinct from cosmetic and other types of care of animals; and, therefore, falls under the definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. The nonveterinarian was enjoined from providing services without a veterinarian supervising the procedures.\n",

    "The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast of the United States during 2005, spurred changes to the way animals are treated during natural disasters. In 2006, Hawaii, Louisiana, and New Hampshire all enacted laws that address issues regarding the care of animals during disasters, such as providing shelters for pets and allowing service animals to be kept with the people they serve. In addition, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act during 2006, which requires state and local emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans information on how they will accommodate household pets and service animals in case of a disaster. California passed a law that will require its Office of Emergency Services, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies involved with disaster response preparation to develop a plan for the needs of service animals, livestock, equids, and household pets in the event of a disaster or major emergency.\n",

    "The animal health industry became caught up in a number of patent and trademark lawsuits during the past year. In 1994, Barclay Slocum obtained patents for the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy procedure, which is used in the treatment of dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture, and for the devices used in the procedure. During 2006, Slocum Enterprises filed a patent infringement suit against New Generation Devices, arguing that the Unity Cruciate Plate manufactured by New Generation infringed on the patent for the Slocum TPLO plate. However, the court never reached a decision on the issue of patent infringement, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the small number of plates sold in the state in which the case was filed and the information provided on a Web site maintained by Slocum Enterprises. Other patent battles waged during 2006 concerned the use of laser technology for onychectomy in cats, pet identification chips, pig vaccines, and pet “deshedding” tools.\n",

The court held that the intention of the legislature in passing the Veterinary Profession Act was the protection of the public and animals and further held that monopolistic statutes serve the purpose of protecting the public. In addition, the court concluded that dentistry, at its core, relates to the health of the teeth and gums; is distinct from cosmetic and other types of care of animals; and, therefore, falls under the definition of the practice of veterinary medicine. The nonveterinarian was enjoined from providing services without a veterinarian supervising the procedures.\n",

In 2006, Hawaii, Louisiana, and New Hampshire all enacted laws that address issues regarding the care of animals during disasters, such as providing shelters for pets and allowing service animals to be kept with the people they serve. In addition, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act during 2006, which requires state and local emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans information on how they will accommodate household pets and service animals in case of a disaster. California passed a law that will require its Office of Emergency Services, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies involved with disaster response preparation to develop a plan for the needs of service animals, livestock, equids, and household pets in the event of a disaster or major emergency.\n",
